# answering questions, ask a question using the link BELOW (if there's no link, my future self got too lazy)
(link coming soon)

## Question 1 from rdgfb: I noticed a person in (online platform) that has "rdgfb" in it! Is that you? or is a impostor AMON-
let me stop you, my past self, from making an among us reference. no, that isn't me. 

if i had anything, i'd have it in the "official link section, because advertising".

## Question 2 from rdgfb: My username/name/etc in (online platform) has "rdgfb" in it. Do I need to scream and run around in circles?
no, there's no reason to. i'm not the type to take down anything. if you're aiming to show off my stuff on youtube, i'm gonna set some rules.

HOWEVER, if you do have it with the INTENTION of saying you're specifically me... yeah, you better start doing this: https://youtu.be/fxMr8RO5BAg

## Question 3 from rdgfb: can i use anything here for my own projects?
well, of course! no need to ask. in fact, i encourage you to mess with these!

## Question 4 from rdgfb: if i use anything for my own projects, do i have to do anything required?
i'll only need credit for the platformer. otherwise, it's recommended, but no need.

## Question 5 from rdgfb: do you have (platform)?
if it's not in the "official link section, because advertising", the answer's very likely "no, i do not".

# rules for showing off my stuff on youtube
## NOTICE: unless I specifically say that I give no mercy, breaking any of these rules by a genuine mistake will not be punishing.
i will be happy to help fix the mistake!

## RULE 1: don't impersonate!!
i'm not gonna give ya mercy if ya do.. with only ONE exception.

## the exception: it's an april fools joke on april fools, and you change your channel to be me.
if ya do, set it up no earlier than March 31st, and go back to normal no later than April 2nd. 

## RULE 2: if you are showing off OR editing my stuff for a video, you MUST put a link to the project in the description, that is EASILY accessable, and is from my website.
this means NO LINK SHORTENING!! if ya need to shorten, please ask.

## OPTIONAL: share your edited project with me.
there's a chance i may put it on my website, with the video link!

## if you have ANY questions about these rules, ask me!
