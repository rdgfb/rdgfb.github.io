## answering questions section 1: outside things

# i noticed a youtube channel (or anything else) starting with rdgfb!
that isn't me. if i had anything, i'd have it in the "official link section, because advertising". however, i won't take it down!

# can i use anything here?
well, of course! no need to ask. in fact, i encourage you to mess with these!

# if i use anything, do i have to do anything required?
i'll only need credit for the platformer. otherwise, it's recommended, but no need.

# do you have (platform)?
if it's not in the "official link section, because advertising", the answer's very likely "no, i do not".
