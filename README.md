# rdgfb.github.io
## the site that is rarily updated!
## a lot of things here are probably being developed on.
## i guess this is where developing projects of mine exist

# official link section, because advertising
https://www.github.com/rdgfb/

# i decided to redo this because i want to get rid of the among us joke from early-mid 2022.

## can i use these projects for my own use? please help i'm screaming and running around in circles.
yes, of course you can. all i ask is if you are using this for public use, credit me (link the github repository and the website) and if you put it on your own website, make some changes, and of course credit me as well (link the github repository and where the original project is in rdgfb.github.io) so you can avoid doing this: https://youtu.be/fxMr8RO5BAg

## wait, you said this was for developing projects of yours, but where would you release it??
